Art maps in R
I am trying to create some art maps in R based on the beautiful tutorial by Esteban Moro (http://estebanmoro.org/post/2020-10-19-personal-art-map-with-r/)
However, I am struggling to manually enter the personal location history onto the map. 
Included in this respository are:
1) My current .rmd file, which will show you the errors I am receiving in R
2) The .csv location file I am trying to work with to manually enter my location data, as I did not have my Google location data turned on
3) A .pdf of the Seattle map to show that everything works up until the point of adding the personal location data

Thanks in advance for any support you are able to offer!
